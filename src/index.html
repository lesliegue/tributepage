            <p>
             <strong> A hundred years of solitude (1967)</strong> - Every era has its founding myth, and ours is this novel. When it came out, it provoked an authentic revolution in Latin American literature. Its characters have become part of the neighborhood shared by Spanish-language readers.

               <p>
               <strong> Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1981) </strong> - Compact, violent, fascinating and perfect: it is one of García Márquez's most remembered books, because it displays an impeccable narrative technique. We know the outcome from the first page, but we fear the worst before the end. </p> </li>
            <li>
                <p>
